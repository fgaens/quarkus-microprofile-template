/**
 * System tests for REST resources using MicroProfile REST clients.
 * <p>
 * This package maintains parity with the service module's package structure.
 * The source folder src/test/java contains the test implementation, while src/main/java
 * provides both the resources under test and their corresponding REST client interfaces.
 * <p>
 * System test classes are named after resources with the "IT" suffix.
